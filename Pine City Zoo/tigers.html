            Tigers are the largest of the big cats and are known for their
            power, agility, and striking appearance. Their bold stripes provide
            excellent camouflage in dense vegetation. Tigers are solitary and
            territorial, marking their domain with scent and scratches.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal,
            Siberian, and Sumatran tigers. Each has adapted to its specific
            environment, from snowy forests to tropical jungles.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Fun Fact: </b>No two tigers have the same stripe patternâ€”each is
            as unique as a fingerprint.
