          <br />
          <p><b>Scientific Name: </b>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</p>
          <p><b>Family: </b>Ursidae</p>
          <p><b>Habitat: </b>Mountain forests in central China</p>

            Giant pandas are beloved for their distinct black-and-white fur and
            gentle temperament. Though they are classified as carnivores, their
            diet is over 99% bamboo. Pandas have a special “thumb”—an extended
            wrist bone—that helps them grip bamboo stems.
          </p>

            They are solitary animals, coming together only to breed. Female
            pandas give birth to tiny, blind cubs that weigh just a few ounces
            at birth.

            conservation efforts)
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Fun Fact: </b>A panda can eat up to 40 pounds (18 kg) of bamboo a
            day!
