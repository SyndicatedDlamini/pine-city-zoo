            Koalas are iconic marsupials native to Australia. Despite being
            called "koala bears," they are not bears at all. They spend nearly
            all their time in eucalyptus trees, which provide both their food
            and shelter. Koalas have a special digestive system that detoxifies
            the otherwise poisonous eucalyptus leaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            They sleep up to 20 hours a day due to their low-energy diet and are
            mostly solitary animals. Baby koalas, called joeys, stay in their
            mother's pouch for about six months.

            <b>Fun Fact: </b>Each koala has a unique fingerprintâ€”just like
            humans!
