          <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
          <br />
          <p><b>Scientific Name: </b>Giraffa camelopardalis</p>
          <p><b>Family: </b>Giraffidae</p>
          <p>
            <b>Habitat: </b>Savannahs, open woodlands, and grasslands of
            sub-Saharan Africa
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Giraffes are the world’s tallest land animals, reaching heights up
            to 18 feet (5.5 meters). Their long necks, though they have the same
            number of vertebrae as humans, allow them to browse leaves high in
            acacia trees. Each giraffe has a unique pattern of spots, like a
            fingerprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            They live in loose herds and are generally peaceful and social.
            Despite their height, giraffes have to awkwardly spread their legs
            to drink water from a pond.
          </p>

          <p><b>Conservation Status: </b>Vulnerable</p>
          <p>
            <b>Fun Fact: </b>A giraffe’s heart can weigh up to 25 pounds and
            must pump blood all the way up that long neck to the brain!
          </p>
          <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
          <p>You will find them at G15, just beyond the research centre</p>
