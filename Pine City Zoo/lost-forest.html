            Wander into the Lost Forest, a lush, shaded haven where adventure
            meets tranquility. This immersive area is home to some of the zoo’s
            most elusive and fascinating creatures all nestled beneath a canopy
            of greenery. But it’s not all mystery and mist—
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lost Forest also offers peaceful picnic spots where families and
            friends can unwind, enjoy their packed meals, and take a quiet break
            surrounded by nature. Whether you’re exploring hidden paths or
            simply soaking in the serenity, the Lost Forest is the perfect place
            to pause, refresh, and reconnect with the wild.

            The lost Forest is located in the east of the zoo, beyond the monkey
            trail
