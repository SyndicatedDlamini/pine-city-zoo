          <p><b>Scientific Name: </b>Oryx gazella</p>
          <p><b>Family: </b>Bovidae</p>
          <p>
            <b>Habitat: </b>Arid regions, including deserts and savannahs in
            Southern Africa

            The gemsbok, also known as the South African oryx, is a large
            antelope well-adapted to life in dry, harsh climates. With long,
            spear-like horns and bold facial markings, these majestic animals
            are known for their resilience. They can survive extreme heat and go
            for long periods without water, extracting moisture from their food.
          </p>
          <p>
            They usually live in herds of 10â€“40 animals, often led by a dominant
            female. Their horns are used for defense and dominance disputes
            within the group.

          <p><b>Conservation Status: </b>Least Concern</p>
          <p>
            <b>Fun Fact: </b>Gemsbok can raise their body temperature to avoid
            sweating, conserving water.
          </p>
          <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
          <p>You will find the gemsbok just beyond the Panda Canyon</p>
