          <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Scientific Name:</b> Loxodonta africana (African Elephant) /
            Elephas maximus (Asian Elephant)
          </p>
          <p><b>Family:</b> Elephantidae</p>
          <p>
            <b>Habitat:</b> Grasslands, forests, and savannahs across Africa and
            Asia
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. African elephants,
            with their large ears and tusks, roam the savannahs and forests of
            sub-Saharan Africa. Asian elephants, slightly smaller with smaller
            ears and less prominent tusks, inhabit tropical forests and
            grasslands across South and Southeast Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Highly intelligent and social, elephants live in tight-knit family
            groups led by a matriarch—the oldest and often wisest female. They
            communicate through low-frequency rumbles and have incredible
            memories. Their trunks are versatile tools used for breathing,
            feeding, drinking, and even greeting each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Conservation Status:</b> African Elephant – Vulnerable; Asian
            Elephant – Endangered
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Fun Fact:</b> Elephants can recognize themselves in mirrors—a
            rare trait shared with only a few other species.
          </p>
          <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
          <p>
            You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the
            ampitheatre
