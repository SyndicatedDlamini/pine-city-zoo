            <b>Scientific Name: </b>Gorilla gorilla (Western Gorilla) / Gorilla
            beringei (Eastern Gorilla)
          </p>
          <p><b>Family: </b>Hominidae</p>

            Gorillas are the largest of the primates and are closely related to
            humans, sharing about 98% of our DNA. They live in family groups
            called troops, led by a dominant silverback male. These intelligent
            animals are known for their expressive faces, gentle nature, and
            ability to use tools and communicate using sign-like gestures and
            vocalizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gorillas are primarily herbivores, feeding on fruits, shoots, and
            leaves. They build nests on the ground or in trees each night.

            species)
          </p>

            <b>Fun Fact: </b>Gorillas show emotions like joy and sadness and
            even mourn their dead.
