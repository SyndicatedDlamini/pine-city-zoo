            Lions are powerful big cats and the only species of cats that live
            in social groups called prides. A pride can consist of up to 30
            lions, mostly related females and their cubs, protected by a
            coalition of males.
          </p>
          <p>
            Known for their iconic manes, only male lions grow them, which
            signal age and dominance. Lions hunt in groups and rely on
            cooperation to take down large prey like wildebeests and zebras.
