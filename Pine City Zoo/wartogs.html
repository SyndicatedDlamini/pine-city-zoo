          <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
          <br />
          <p><b>Scientific Name:</b>Phacochoerus africanus</p>
          <p><b>Family: </b>Suidae</p>
          <p>
            <b>Habitat:</b>Savannahs, open plains, and grasslands of sub-Saharan
            Africa
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Warthogs are wild members of the pig family, recognized by their
            tusks, facial warts (actually protective pads), and bristly manes.
            Despite their rugged appearance, warthogs are generally peaceful
            grazers and often seen kneeling while feeding due to their short
            necks.
          </p>
          <p>
            They live in burrows, which they typically back into so their tusks
            face outwards, ready to defend against predators. Warthogs often
            share their burrows with others and can run impressively fast when
            startled.
          </p>
          <p><b>Conservation Status: </b>Least Concern</p>
          <p>
            <b>Fun Fact:</b>Warthogs use mud wallows to cool down and protect
            their skin from parasites.
          </p>
          <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
          <p>
            you will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.
